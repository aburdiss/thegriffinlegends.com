            <h2>Mark Howard</h2>
            <p>
              I’m thrilled you’re here, about to go on this crusade with me.
              It’s been a long pilgrimage already, writing this book. It started
              as a few short scenes I typed out during my freshman year of
              college when I probably should have been studying. Looking back on
              it, the first draft wasn’t exactly what I would call good now. I
              spent the rest of my undergraduate chasing girls, playing video
              games, and wondering why my grades weren’t better.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had this story in the back of my mind, but I wasn’t sure how I
              wanted to change it in the second draft, so I kept putting it off.
              In 2014, I had my bachelor’s, and I decided to start writing again
              in earnest. There were only two problems. I now had a wife and a
              small baby to provide for, and I also decided to pursue a master’s
              degree at this time. This, and that I scrapped most of the ideas
              from the first draft outside of a couple of characters and the
              setting, meant that the next draft took another five years to
              complete. I think the work in front of you is much more mature
              thanks to my experiences in the interim. My master’s degree gave
              me a much greater depth of historical and literary knowledge to
              draw inspiration from, and my time as a husband and father working
              through grad school broadened my personal experiences enough to
              give my characters the depth they deserved.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve always wanted to be an author. My wife shares in this
              ambition for herself, and we intend to make this book the first in
              several series of books set in this world we’ve created. If you
              enjoy what you read, please post a good review online. That will
              help us bring more books to you, and in a more timely manner.
              Thanks!

              I have always loved reading, living the lives of the characters in
              the books as the words unfolded their destinies. Delving into the
              lives of heroes and heroines, young and old, seeing good verses
              evil was a way of living for me. There are so many worlds to see.
              I am grateful that you have chosen to enter our world with us and
              take a journey with our characters.
            </p>

              A teacher in early elementary school ignited my desire to write.
              As with all children, my writing wasn't very good. I kept at it
              though, and my writing has improved by leaps and bounds since
              then. The idea for my first book came to me when I was in high
              school. I wrote the first draft of a chapter for an assignment in
              a creative writing class. Time has changed the story since then.
              While I have kept some of the ideas, much has changed as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot has happened in my life since that first idea. I married the
              man of my dreams. Had children. Got my bachelor's when my oldest
              was a year old. There have been ups and downs. Through it all the
              idea for my book has persisted, though like I stated earlier the
              story has morphed and grown from what it once was.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am so glad that I was able to find a spouse that shares my
              ambition to write. I can't wait to finish my book and share it
              with you.
